# üíª Preparing the Development Environment
## ‚öô Setting up dependencies

First you may clone the project with git.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fer-hnndz/budgetize.git
cd budgetize
```

You'll then need to install all dependencies with `poetry`. You may install the tool with pip before installing Budgetize's dependencies. You may refer to this guide [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
Once installed you may install budgetize's dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```
To run Budgetize from source use the command in the root of the project folder:
```
poetry run main.py --dev
```
**NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT YOU RUN IN DEV MODE WITH THE `--dev` FLAG. OTHERWISE IT WILL CONNECT TO YOUR REAL BUDGETIZE DB INSTEAD OF THE TEST DATABASE.**\
You can also spawn a textual console that will allow you to see the app's output.\
In another terminal, run:
```bash
poetry run textual console
```

## ‚úç Git Workflow
It is suggested you run `poetry run pre-commit install` so all checks are ran automatically everytime you commit.\
For contributing, just follow these steps:
1. Create a branch for the feature you want to implement/bug to fix.
   - Use `feature/feature-name` if you are going to implement a feature
   - Use `bugfix/bug-name` if you are solving a bug. 
2. Be sure to comment anything useful for explanation and annotate functions the most you can following the [Google Docstring Style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
3. Before committing, run `poetry run pre-commit run`. (You may skip this if you already installed pre-commit)

When submitting your pull request make sure to name it accordingly and explain in detail what you changed. Thanks for contributing!
