# üíª Preparing the Development Environment
## ‚öô Setting up dependencies

First you may clone the project with git.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fer-hnndz/budgetize.git
cd budgetize
```

You'll then need to install all dependencies with `poetry`. You may install the tool with pip before installing Budgetize's dependencies. You may refer to this guide [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
Once installed you may install budgetize's dependencies.
```bash
poetry install Pipfile
poetry shell
```
You'll then activate poetry's virtual environment that will allow you to run Budgetize with
``` bash
textual run main.py --dev
```
**NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT YOU RUN THE APP WITH THIS COMMAND SINCE IF IT IS WITHOUT THE `--dev` FLAG OR RAN WITH THE PYTHON INTERPRETER, IT WILL CONNECT TO YOUR REAL BUDGETIZE DB INSTEAD OF THE TEST DATABASE.**\
You can also spawn a textual console that will allow you to see the app's output.\
In another terminal, spawn a poetry shell and run:
```bash
textual console
```

## ‚úç Git Workflow
It is suggested you run `poetry run pre-commit install` so all checks are ran automatically everytime you commit.\
For contributing, just follow these steps:
1. Create a branch for the feature you want to implement/bug to fix.
2. Be sure to comment anything useful for explanation and annotate functions the most you can.
3. Before committing, run `poetryrun pre-commit run`. (You may skip this if you already installed pre-commit)

When submitting your pull request make sure to name it accordingly and explain in detail what you changed. Thanks for contributing!
